Thanks for trying out my autoexec! Hopefully you like it.

STEPS:
1. Drag and drop all the .cfg files into your CSGO cfg directory
   (Steam\SteamApps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg)
2. Use these launch options if you want (most widely used ones are -high, -freq, -threads, -nod3d9ex1 & +mat_queue_mode 2):
-novid -high -freq [WHATEVER YOUR REFRESH RATE IS] -threads 4 -console +exec autoexec -steam -noforcemparms -noforcemaccel -noforcemspd -processheap -nod3d9ex1 +mat_queue_mode 2 -language custom
3. Launch CS:GO
4. type "exec autoexec" in console (just incase the alunch options bug out like they sometimes do)
 *you can just type "autoexec" after typing the full command once*
5. Read the genetrated text and tables, and enjoy!
