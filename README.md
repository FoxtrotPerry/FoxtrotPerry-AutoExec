# FoxtrotPerry Autoexec v5.0.1!

### Thanks for trying out my autoexec! Hopefully you like it.

If you are here you probably came from some reddit post or something so you probably already know what you're getting with this autoexec. In the rare case you found yourself here and dont know what this gives you, you can view a bind map by clicking [HERE.](http://bit.ly/FPbinds_v501)

## Notable Features:
* **Modular Binds** - With the release of v5.0.1 I have *finally* integrated my idea for modular binds into every configurable section this autoexec has to offer. With modular binds, you get to pick and choose which keys and settings you want changed in your active config. Which means you can use parts of your config and parts of mine!

    * How to use: 
        1. Use the `binds` command to view all available bind and config commands. 
        2. If you see some you like, you can go to http://bit.ly/FPbinds_v501 to see if the binds will conflict with the keys you currently have bound.
        3. If you see no conflicts, go ahead and use the commands you chose and from there you're all set!

* **FastQ** - When 'q' is depressed, knife will be out. When released, the original gun will be re-selected (rip q)
* **Built in spray patterns** - ASCII spray patterns printed to console that also have built in bullet numbers located at key sections of the pattern. (currently only supports the AK and M4A4)
* **Economy cheat sheet** - Lists kill rewards, loss bonuses, and various round win bonus scenarios.
* **XH Cycler and Modifier** - I know some people periododically become complacent with their existing crosshair so I made an optional command in the bind section that allows `+` to be bound in a way where it cycles between the 19 different presets this autoexec has to offer. When taking advantage of all crosshair commands built into this autoexec, there are *190* different crosshair possibilities. Use the `xh` command to see all available commands for crosshair configuration.
* **Throw Binds** - Optional binds that allow for automated jump throws, run and jump throws, and run throws.
* **Conveneince Aliases** - Example: typing the name of a weapon will drop the weapon (instead of `give weapon name`).
* **Resolution Changer** - Change your res on the fly with one of many simple res presets listed in the `res` command table (useful for setting up on LAN).
* **Shorthand Commands** - Commands that are regularly annoying to remember are reduced to just a few letters at most (example: "disconnect" -> "dc"). Other shorthand commands can be found by using the "commands" command.
* **CleanShift** - Decal clearing command is bound to SHIFT so periodic clearing of decals can be expected with normal game play.
* **League Binds** - /u/Jaggerjack3d had the idea to make a league orientated toggle. So just type "leaguebinds" to disable all double key binds and instead bind the release of nades to 'N'
* **Keypad Buy Binds** - Pretty much self explanatory.
